    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        An apple dumpling is a baked or boiled pastry-wrapped apple.
        To prepare apple dumplings, apples are peeled, cored and 
        sometimes quartered and placed on a portion of dough. 
        The hole from the core may be filled with cinnamon, 
        butter and sugar and sometimes dried fruit such as raisins, 
        sultanas, or currants. The dough is folded over the apples 
        and sealed. Sometimes a spiced sauce is poured over the 
        dumplings which are then baked until tender; the sugar 
        and butter create a sweet sauce. Apple dumplings can be 
        served hot, cold, or room temperature for breakfast, dessert, 
        or as a main dish.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 apples, diced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>½ cup brown sugar(110 g)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>1 sheet puff pastry</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375ºF.</li>
        <li>
            In a medium pan, melt the butter.
            Add the brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, and salt,
            and stir until the sugar has melted completely and
            formed a sauce. Add the apples and toss until the
            apples are fully coated in the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove pan from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            On a floured surface, roll out the puff pastry
             until it has doubled in size. Cut 4-inch squares.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk egg with 1 tablespoon of water to form an egg wash.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fill each square with 1½ tablespoons of apples. 
            (Reserve extra syrup from apples.) Brush the edges of
            the squares with egg wash. Fold each corner of pastry
            over the apples until the apples are completely enclosed 
            in the dumpling. Brush entire dumpling with egg wash.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for 18–20 minutes, until golden brown. Dust with
            powdered sugar and drizzle with reserved syrup.
        </li>
        <li>
            Enjoy!
