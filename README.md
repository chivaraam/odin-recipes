# odin-recipes
here I have created a website that has recipes to Mexican Strawberry Water (Agua de Fresa), Apple Dumplings and Peanut Butter Banana Ice-Cream.
these recipes are linked with anchor tag and are displayed in the main page.
So when we click the recipes we need, It goes to that relative link and show us the Ingredients and steps needed to create them.
